      <h4><b>Alima Creativity</b></h4>
      <h6><i>Creativity is to see what others dont</i></h6>
      <p>My name is Alima and I study in LaGuardia Community College for New Media Technology major. I want to reach my full potential as a current student and as a future specialist in Graphic Design industry. I consider myself as a curious and versatile person because I love trying new things and going to different exhibitions and events. I try to update myself with available sources online, like watching different tutorials about Adobe Illustrator, PhotoShop and Adobe Premiere Pro, Acrylic Pouring, Digital Photography, Cross stitching and many more. I used to go to poetry club and this creativity technique helped me to develop the final project for the current semester. Lately I have been interested in acrylic painting technique. I am looking forward to experiment in this area more often and to see the final result of it. The painting come up in abstract way and it will be unique since the fluid painting flow around all over the canvas and no one knows what the final result image would be. I noticed in order to perform the art, it is similar to writing a poem. There were moments when I wanted to write a poem but couldnâ€™t and there were moments when the muse visited me and I just had lines of the poem in my mind. So Practice and patience skills are very important and it plays a huge role in every aspect of creativity. As an artist, I want to transfer a history of Kazakh culture patterns, shapes and ornaments on digital media like Illustration, Digital Images, Paintings, and Drawings. We can see Kazakh symbols in clothes, utensils, jewelry and other objects that are coming from 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. When craftsmen and craftswomen decorated clothes with Kazakh ornaments, it serves not only as a decoration but people do believe that it can attract luck and happiness. My dream is to create silk scarfs with Kazakh ornaments and shapes that can highlight the beauty, elegance and emotions of the women.</p>
